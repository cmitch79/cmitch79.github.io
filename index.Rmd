- Inaccuracies in age calculation cost the US economy an estimated $1.2B annually
- 60% of Americans use "smart" cellular telephones or computers capable of accessing the Internet on a daily basis

#### The Future

### <font color = #20B2AA> So How Does it Work? </font>

#### Here's an exclusive look at the revolutionary technology behind the app:
```{r}
age <- function(bdate)
{round(as.numeric(difftime(Sys.Date(), as.Date(bdate), unit="weeks"))/52.25, digits = 2)}
```
</br>
#### Let's use it to calculate the age of someone who was born on July 1, 1971:
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=NA}
bdate <- as.Date('1971-07-01')
age(bdate)
```
